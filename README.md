# Advent Of Code - 2018

Another year, another try to see if I can manage to make it till the end (probably not).

## Structure

So like the previous years, each day part is present in a separate directory with it's own files.

## Check solution of the day.

To check the solution of each day part, you'll need the C# 6.0 compiler (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn#download-c-and-visual-basic) present in your PATH environment variables. After that is setup, it is an easy 1-2-3 step in order to get the solution.

### 1. Go to the directory of the file.
```
cd C:\Projects\GitHub\adventofcode-2018\day-1-1
```

### 2. Build all C# files into a solution.
```
csc /out:solution.exe *.cs
```

### 3. Execute the solution.
```
solution.exe
```
